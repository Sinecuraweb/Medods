Ни одного штриха не мог бы я сделать, а никогда не был таким большим художником, как в эти минуты. Когда от милой моей долины поднимается пар и полдневное солнце стоит над непроницаемой чащей темного леса и лишь редкий луч проскальзывает в его святая святых, а я лежу в высокой траве у быстрого ручья и, прильнув к земле, вижу тысячи всевозможных былинок и чувствую, как близок моему сердцу крошечный мирок, что снует между стебельками, наблюдаю эти неисчислимые, непостижимые разновидности червяков и мошек и чувствую близость всемогущего, создавшего нас по своему подобию, веяние вселюбящего, судившего нам парить в вечном блаженстве, когда взор мой туманится и все вокруг меня и небо надо мной запечатлены в моей душе, точно образ возлюбленной, - тогда, дорогой друг, меня часто томит мысль: \"Ах!

Пятидверный хетчбэк разрабатывается под прежним условным обозначением «Whitestar» фирменным филиалом в Детройте. После окончания проектно-конструкторских работ фабрика должна производить в Калифорнии первоначально 10 000, позже — 25 000 автомобилей модели.\r\n\r\nПоставка автомобилей в США началась 22 июня 2012 года[13]. Изначально предлагалось две версии: на 60 и 85 кВт⋅ч, оборудованные одним электродвигателем, расположенным на задней оси. Затем, 9 октября 2014 года, появилась опция с электродвигателями на каждой оси, а уже с 8 апреля 2015 года компания полностью отказалась от однодвигательной комплектации и от 60 кВт⋅ч версии. С этого времени все выпускающиеся машины оборудованы двумя электродвигателями, полным приводом и в базовой версии оснащаются 70 кВт⋅ч батареей. Стартовая цена начинается от 75 750 долларов в США. В зависимости от комплектации, без перезарядки автомобиль сможет проехать 442, 502 и 480 километров[14].\r\n\r\n12 ноября 2012 года автомобиль получил награду «Автомобиль года» от американского журнала Motor Trend[15].\r\n\r\nПоставки моделей S и X в 2015 и 2016 годах[16][17]:\r\n\r\n30 марта 2018 года компания Tesla отозвала около 123 тыс. автомобилей серии Model S, которые были выпущены до апреля 2016, для замены деталей гидроусилителя руля. Обуславливалось это тем, что болты гидроусилителя подвержены коррозии в холодное время года. Такое воздействие оказывается из-за соли, которую используют в целях предотвращения обледенения на дорогах.[18]"}, "commit"=>"Update Board", "id"=>"11"}

Пятидверный хетчбэк разрабатывается под прежним условным обозначением «Whitestar» фирменным филиалом в Детройте. После окончания проектно-конструкторских работ фабрика должна производить в Калифорнии первоначально 10 000, позже — 25 000 автомобилей модели.\r\n\r\nПоставка автомобилей в США началась 22 июня 2012 года[13]. Изначально предлагалось две версии: на 60 и 85 кВт⋅ч, оборудованные одним электродвигателем, расположенным на задней оси. Затем, 9 октября 2014 года, появилась опция с электродвигателями на каждой оси, а уже с 8 апреля 2015 года компания полностью отказалась от однодвигательной комплектации и от 60 кВт⋅ч версии. С этого времени все выпускающиеся машины оборудованы двумя электродвигателями, полным приводом и в базовой версии оснащаются 70 кВт⋅ч батареей. Стартовая цена начинается от 75 750 долларов в США. В зависимости от комплектации, без перезарядки автомобиль сможет проехать 442, 502 и 480 километров[14].\r\n\r\n12 ноября 2012 года автомобиль получил награду «Автомобиль года» от американского журнала Motor Trend[15].\r\n\r\nПоставки моделей S и X в 2015 и 2016 годах[16][17]:\r\n\r\n30 марта 2018 года компания Tesla отозвала около 123 тыс. автомобилей серии Model S, которые были выпущены до апреля 2016, для замены деталей гидроусилителя руля. Обуславливалось это тем, что болты гидроусилителя подвержены коррозии в холодное время года. Такое воздействие оказывается из-за соли, которую используют в целях предотвращения обледенения на дорогах.[18]"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-23 07:40:40.069001"], ["id", 11]]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
