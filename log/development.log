Ни одного штриха не мог бы я сделать, а никогда не был таким большим художником, как в эти минуты. Когда от милой моей долины поднимается пар и полдневное солнце стоит над непроницаемой чащей темного леса и лишь редкий луч проскальзывает в его святая святых, а я лежу в высокой траве у быстрого ручья и, прильнув к земле, вижу тысячи всевозможных былинок и чувствую, как близок моему сердцу крошечный мирок, что снует между стебельками, наблюдаю эти неисчислимые, непостижимые разновидности червяков и мошек и чувствую близость всемогущего, создавшего нас по своему подобию, веяние вселюбящего, судившего нам парить в вечном блаженстве, когда взор мой туманится и все вокруг меня и небо надо мной запечатлены в моей душе, точно образ возлюбленной, - тогда, дорогой друг, меня часто томит мысль: \"Ах!

Пятидверный хетчбэк разрабатывается под прежним условным обозначением «Whitestar» фирменным филиалом в Детройте. После окончания проектно-конструкторских работ фабрика должна производить в Калифорнии первоначально 10 000, позже — 25 000 автомобилей модели.\r\n\r\nПоставка автомобилей в США началась 22 июня 2012 года[13]. Изначально предлагалось две версии: на 60 и 85 кВт⋅ч, оборудованные одним электродвигателем, расположенным на задней оси. Затем, 9 октября 2014 года, появилась опция с электродвигателями на каждой оси, а уже с 8 апреля 2015 года компания полностью отказалась от однодвигательной комплектации и от 60 кВт⋅ч версии. С этого времени все выпускающиеся машины оборудованы двумя электродвигателями, полным приводом и в базовой версии оснащаются 70 кВт⋅ч батареей. Стартовая цена начинается от 75 750 долларов в США. В зависимости от комплектации, без перезарядки автомобиль сможет проехать 442, 502 и 480 километров[14].\r\n\r\n12 ноября 2012 года автомобиль получил награду «Автомобиль года» от американского журнала Motor Trend[15].\r\n\r\nПоставки моделей S и X в 2015 и 2016 годах[16][17]:\r\n\r\n30 марта 2018 года компания Tesla отозвала около 123 тыс. автомобилей серии Model S, которые были выпущены до апреля 2016, для замены деталей гидроусилителя руля. Обуславливалось это тем, что болты гидроусилителя подвержены коррозии в холодное время года. Такое воздействие оказывается из-за соли, которую используют в целях предотвращения обледенения на дорогах.[18]"}, "commit"=>"Update Board", "id"=>"11"}

Пятидверный хетчбэк разрабатывается под прежним условным обозначением «Whitestar» фирменным филиалом в Детройте. После окончания проектно-конструкторских работ фабрика должна производить в Калифорнии первоначально 10 000, позже — 25 000 автомобилей модели.\r\n\r\nПоставка автомобилей в США началась 22 июня 2012 года[13]. Изначально предлагалось две версии: на 60 и 85 кВт⋅ч, оборудованные одним электродвигателем, расположенным на задней оси. Затем, 9 октября 2014 года, появилась опция с электродвигателями на каждой оси, а уже с 8 апреля 2015 года компания полностью отказалась от однодвигательной комплектации и от 60 кВт⋅ч версии. С этого времени все выпускающиеся машины оборудованы двумя электродвигателями, полным приводом и в базовой версии оснащаются 70 кВт⋅ч батареей. Стартовая цена начинается от 75 750 долларов в США. В зависимости от комплектации, без перезарядки автомобиль сможет проехать 442, 502 и 480 километров[14].\r\n\r\n12 ноября 2012 года автомобиль получил награду «Автомобиль года» от американского журнала Motor Trend[15].\r\n\r\nПоставки моделей S и X в 2015 и 2016 годах[16][17]:\r\n\r\n30 марта 2018 года компания Tesla отозвала около 123 тыс. автомобилей серии Model S, которые были выпущены до апреля 2016, для замены деталей гидроусилителя руля. Обуславливалось это тем, что болты гидроусилителя подвержены коррозии в холодное время года. Такое воздействие оказывается из-за соли, которую используют в целях предотвращения обледенения на дорогах.[18]"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-23 07:40:40.069001"], ["id", 11]]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Новинка будет самым дешевым автомобилем в модельной линейке американского производителя. Она будет производиться в калифорнии, но доберется до своих покупателей лишь под конец 2017 года. Однако сделать предварительный заказ можно уже сегодня, достаточно внести сумму в 1000 долларов США. Лишь в первые дни после презентации, в очередь за новинкой выстроились около 276 тысяч человек.\r\n\r\nTesla Model 3 получила запоминающийся, но в то же время простой дизайн. На передке автомобиля больше нет радиаторной решетки, громоздкая система охлаждения не нужна электрокарам, это позволяет добиться более обтекаемой формы, что положительно влияет как на комфорт в салоне, так и на расход топлива во время поездок по скоростным шоссе.\r\n\r\nTesla Model 3- автомобиль использующий электрическую тягу. По сравнению с привычными для нас двигателями внутреннего сгорания, электромотор обладает массой плюсов. Стоит отметить его тишину и необычные показатели мощности и крутящего момента. Электрический двигатель способен выдавать свой максимальный крутящий момент практически сразу, его не обязательно раскручивать до определенных оборотов, как двигатель внутреннего сгорания. Благодаря этому чудесному свойству, электрокарам не нужна коробка передач, а также они способны очень быстро ускоряться. Tesla Model 3 в базовой комплектации, с задним приводом способна срываться с места до скорости в сто километров в час всего за 6 секунд, а более дорогие, полноприводные версии, проделывают это упражнение за 4 секунды. Кроме того, благодаря аккумуляторам на 60 кВт/ч, седан способен преодолеть без подзарядки до 350 километров.\r\n", "all_tags"=>"60 kWh, 3.5 c", "picture"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007f24f41b3238 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20190128-6965-1pe5wza.jpg>, @original_filename="tesla model 3.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"board[picture]\"; filename=\"tesla model 3.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "user_id"=>"Elon Musk ", "commit"=>"Применить изменения", "id"=>"1"}

Как и другие модели Tesla серии S, данная версия это уникальный hi-tech электромобиль с богатой комплектацией инновационными технологиями.\r\n\r\nСущественных отличий от других моделей серии выпуск которых стартовал в 2016 году, в автомобили нет. Преимущественно изменения коснулись вариативности отделки салона и, конечно же, работе полного привода.\r\n\r\nДля работы полного привода Tesla Model S 90D на электромобиль было установлено адаптированное программное обеспечение. Новое ПО работает в тандеме с независимой пневмоподвеской, изменяющей клиренс автомобиля в зависимости от состояния дорожного покрытия. Работе способствуют наличие сенсоров считывающих информацию о его изменениях и передающих ее бортовому компьютеру. Таким образом, высота дорожного просвета может автоматически изменяться несколько раз на протяжении всего маршрута. Полный привод добавил электромобилю курсовой устойчивости и управляемости, но лишь слегка увеличил проходимость автомобиля.\r\nСущественные изменения ожидали владельцев Tesla Model S 90D в выборе опций.

Как и другие модели Tesla серии S, данная версия это уникальный hi-tech электромобиль с богатой комплектацией инновационными технологиями.\r\n\r\nСущественных отличий от других моделей серии выпуск которых стартовал в 2016 году, в автомобили нет. Преимущественно изменения коснулись вариативности отделки салона и, конечно же, работе полного привода.\r\n\r\nДля работы полного привода Tesla Model S 90D на электромобиль было установлено адаптированное программное обеспечение. Новое ПО работает в тандеме с независимой пневмоподвеской, изменяющей клиренс автомобиля в зависимости от состояния дорожного покрытия. Работе способствуют наличие сенсоров считывающих информацию о его изменениях и передающих ее бортовому компьютеру. Таким образом, высота дорожного просвета может автоматически изменяться несколько раз на протяжении всего маршрута. Полный привод добавил электромобилю курсовой устойчивости и управляемости, но лишь слегка увеличил проходимость автомобиля.\r\nСущественные изменения ожидали владельцев Tesla Model S 90D в выборе опций.

Как и другие модели Tesla серии S, данная версия это уникальный hi-tech электромобиль с богатой комплектацией инновационными технологиями.\r\n\r\nСущественных отличий от других моделей серии выпуск которых стартовал в 2016 году, в автомобили нет. Преимущественно изменения коснулись вариативности отделки салона и, конечно же, работе полного привода.\r\n\r\nДля работы полного привода Tesla Model S 90D на электромобиль было установлено адаптированное программное обеспечение. Новое ПО работает в тандеме с независимой пневмоподвеской, изменяющей клиренс автомобиля в зависимости от состояния дорожного покрытия. Работе способствуют наличие сенсоров считывающих информацию о его изменениях и передающих ее бортовому компьютеру. Таким образом, высота дорожного просвета может автоматически изменяться несколько раз на протяжении всего маршрута. Полный привод добавил электромобилю курсовой устойчивости и управляемости, но лишь слегка увеличил проходимость автомобиля.\r\nСущественные изменения ожидали владельцев Tesla Model S 90D в выборе опций. Компания Tesla предлагала владельцам автомобиля множество вариаций оформления салона. Обновления включали:\r\n\r\nтри варианта оформления крыши электромобиля (металлическую в цвет кузова, сплошную стеклянную, активную панорамную);\r\nулучшенную версию автопилота;\r\nрасширенную цветовую палитру вариантов покраски автомобиля;\r\nновые форматы отделки салона;\r\nновый дизайн колесных дисков;\r\nновые тормозные суппорты;\r\nустановку вентилируемых сидений.\r\nЧто касается ходовых качеств электромобиля, то Tesla Model S 90D благодаря увеличенной емкости батарей немного добавила в динамике и заметно увеличила запас хода. Улучшенные технические характеристики и наличие полного привода коснулись и стоимости автомобиля, который согласно прайс-листу стоит на 10000$ дороже своего аналога с емкость батарей в 75 кВт•ч.", "author"=>"Jerry Smith", "all_tags"=>"ABS, Полный привод"}, "commit"=>"Применить изменения", "id"=>"2"}
